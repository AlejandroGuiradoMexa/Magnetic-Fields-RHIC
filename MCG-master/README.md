The Monte Carlo Glauber implementation was made by:https://github.com/MCGlauber/MCG. This project is based on Python language, so you can run the notebooks with jupyter notebook. The python version is 2.x, if wanted to run it in a later version you can select the option for python 3.x. 

The magnetic field implementation for nucleons participants and spectators was originally made by myself but in collaboration with Eleazar Cuautle and Luciano DÃ­az who made the original code dynamic and added extended funcionality.
